      <h2>Misinformation on Facebook</h2>
      <p><b>2020</b>, a suffocating year, as to why it is a suffocating year, well, the year <b>2020</b> had bushfires that streches for hundreds and thousands of acres in several countries, a powerful pathological lying idiot trying to start World War 3 and most important of all a worldwide pandemic by a virus called Covid 19 or more commonly called as Corona virus.</p>
      <p>When the pandemic started and people starting to socially distance and quarantine at home, everyone are bored so many turned to social media on their computers and phones. Popular social medias that people turned to are Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.</p>
      <p>And the social media that has the most people on is Facebook, are spreading misinformation about everything, from things that happened around the world and thigns that are going to happen in 2020 to curing the virus.</p>
      <p>As to why I wrote virus, it is because virus is very important in 2020 because as of November 2020, it has claimed the lives of over 1.3 million people worldwide.</p>
      <p>On Facebook, there are many trolls or dumbasses, sharing wrong information about what to do to prevent getting infected by virus, curing the virus, virus is fake and the virus is a biological weapon made by China because the virus was first found in China.</p>
      <p>And so, Facebook noticed that how dangerous were the misinformation on their social media so they started to collaborate with different news companies and different industries' companies to provide and to remove and false information on their social media.</p>
      <p>Because of the misinformation, information from unknown sources need to be checked and verified to find out the genuity because without verifying the information it could be dangerous or be manipulated of our opinions by unknown sources.</p>
      <p>After 2020, I am sure that most of the social media would provide genuine information from verified sources.</p>
